About
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, including:

    Gradient Descent
    Stochastic Gradient Descent
    Perceptron
    Adaline
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Linear Regression
    Logistic Regression
    Naive Bayes
    Decision Trees
    K-Means Clustering
The algorithms are implemented using Python and popular data science libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning resource for understanding the core concepts behind these algorithms.
Algorithms
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script, with a corresponding Jupyter Notebook demonstrating its usage on sample datasets. Here's a brief overview of the algorithms included:
